Brief description of the program: Given a partially completed Sudoku puzzle, 
                                  this program will fill in the remaining spaces and solve the puzzle using depth-first search with backtracking.
Inputs: puzzle1.txt, puzzle2.txt, puzzle3.txt, puzzle4.txt, puzzle5.txt
Output: Print out the exercise number followed by the exerciseâ€™s output

This function will print the current sudoku board

This function will return a boolean value after determining if the attempted move is valid

    Start of a nested for loop where the outer loop (for i in range(3):) will run after the inner loop has been iterated through.
    This will help to identify if the attempted move is valid

        The inner loop (for j in range(3):) will iterate before progressing to the outer loop.
